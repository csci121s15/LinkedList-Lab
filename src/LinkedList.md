CSCI II : LinkedList





**Question 1**


To make sure a test of an empty list would work, you have to make a list with no list at all. In addition, you later must go back and secure yourself that the list work by creating a code that you know that it will work.


**Question 2**

In order to figure that the test of a singlenode works, we must again create a code that creates a new list. After that is done, we again go to the methods and create and insert a method.

**Question 3**

Is this asking me a question or some sort of direction?


**Question 4**

The code will still work if you add more nodes if it belongs to the same head. In addition, if you keep adding a new node, a new node will be added to the head thus making the code to work because you're not adding a different node.

**Question 5**

Prev would have to be curr in order to add a second node on the list

**Question 6**
Prev would be set to prev.setNext() because curr is equal to node. In addition, adding prev.setNext will place a node between the first and the third.

**Question 7**

I believe this will give evidence that the code works because we tested all the node and all them work correctly. In addition, we tested adding a new node to the beginning, end, and middle.

**Question 8**

Implementing and creating this method was very challenging from scratch because at first it was hard to understand how nodes work,however, by the end of this lab I learned more efficiently of how nodes work.
