**Question 1:** Need to create an empty list and make a new list with methods that will 
return true when the list is empty

**Question 2:** Create a new list, and use insertion methods and update getName and 
getQuantity to update with the increase in nodes


**Question 3:** Use the bases for question 2 to compensate for the increase in nodes. 


**Question 4:** This code will now update to add more nodes that belong as the head. This
is because the code is written to set a new head when new nodes are inserted


**Question 5:** Prev is used to reset head so that we don't loose an already inserted value
and will then add it the end of the list using curr. 


**Question 6:** prev.setNext() would be needed in this case in order to add a node in the 
middle, because curr is equal to null at the moment so that a new node can be inserted.


**Question 7:** If the tests are constructed correctly and are testing for the right thing
the class should be working correctly, which they appear to be doing so. 


**Question 8:** They are far more intricate then I thought, but by creating them by scratch 
it gave me a better understanding of how they function and how to manipulate them to get your 
desired outcome. Also, it helped me to better understand their construction.
