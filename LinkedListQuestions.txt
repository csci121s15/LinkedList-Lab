**Question 1**
Inorder to test that the methods work on an empty list you have to make an new list with 
nothing in it. Then you need to go to the methods and correctly create the code for them 
that would return the correct answer.

**Question 2**
To test that the methods work on a single node list, we need to again create a new list. 
then you again go to the methods and create and insertion method as well as fixing the 
'getName" and 'getQuantity' methods so that they work with more nodes.

**Question 4**
Your code will still work to add nodes that belong at the head because you insert the new
node to the head every time you add a new node.

**Question 5**
prev would hav to be curr inorder to add second node to the end of the list.

**Question 6**
prev would have to be prev.setNext because curr is null so the prev.setNext will place a 
new node in between prev and curr.

**Question 7**
I this that this is evidence that the class is working because we tested adding a new node
to the begging, end, and middle.

**Question 8**
Implementing the methods "from scratch" was very challenging, however it helped to 
understand the importance of manipulating the methods inorder to get to the finished 
linke list.
